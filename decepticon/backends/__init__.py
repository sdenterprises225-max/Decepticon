# Container-local path where the langgraph image bakes the skills tree
# (see ``containers/langgraph.Dockerfile``). Skills are READ-ONLY knowledge
# and live INSIDE the langgraph container — not the sandbox container —
# so reads happen as fast in-process ``FilesystemBackend`` calls instead
# of cross-container HTTP round-trips. This is the architectural reason
# the sandbox image no longer bakes skills: skills don't belong in an
# isolated execution environment, they belong next to the agent process
# that consumes them.

def make_agent_backend(sandbox):
    """Compose the runtime backend for a Decepticon agent.

    Routes ``/skills/`` to a local ``FilesystemBackend`` reading from the
    baked skill tree inside the langgraph container, and routes everything
    else (notably ``/workspace/``) through the sandbox transport
    (``HTTPSandbox``). Returning a ``CompositeBackend`` lets
    ``SkillsMiddleware`` and ``FilesystemMiddleware`` share the same
    backend object while reading from different physical storage:

      /skills/...   ->  /app/skills/... in the langgraph container (~5ms)
      /workspace/.. ->  sandbox container via HTTP (isolated, persistent)

    This replaces the previous pattern where every middleware used a raw
    sandbox for both paths, which forced an HTTP round-trip per skill
    read (and previously ``docker exec`` on the DockerSandbox path),
    and required the brittle ``_unwrap_backend()`` band-aid in
    ``decepticon.tools.skills`` to undo engagement-path mangling for
    ``/skills/`` lookups.
