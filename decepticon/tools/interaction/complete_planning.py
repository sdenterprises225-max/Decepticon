"""complete_engagement_planning — signal soundwave-to-decepticon handoff.

Soundwave calls this exactly once after RoE / CONOPS / Deconfliction Plan
have been written, validated, and saved to ``/workspace/plan/``. The
emitted custom event tells the CLI to switch its LangGraph assistant_id from
``soundwave`` to ``decepticon`` so the next operator message lands on the
operations agent without the operator restarting the CLI.
